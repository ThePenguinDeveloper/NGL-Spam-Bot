The repository contains a .json file and an instructions .txt

🚀 | ----- USAGE ----- | 🚀
I wrote this code for Axiom Automated Browser. It's a free web extension you can download from the "Extensions" page of your browser. 
To make it work, open the Axiom extension and create a new project. Once you did that, go on the project setting (the setting button is located in the top-right corner of the screen) and click upload a file. Select the .json you downloaded from here and there you go, you can spam messages on your friends!
